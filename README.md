<P><B> VERSION 2.0.0 HAS BEEN RELEASED, RSM SHOULD MAKE NOISE NOW</B></P>
As of Version 2.0.0 the user must enter the code in order to edit the perameters of the song. RSM is still in beta and probably has a few problems, we will be working to fix these, 
if you find a bug please message Vannilaorange so he can try and fix it, thank you.
  <i>This project is dedicated to my boyfriend Rory, who issued me a challenge to make it.</i>
