# Random-Song-Maker
# Version 1.2.0
A student project designed to generate a random song based off of parameters set by the user.
As of 1.2.0, RSM cannot produce an form of noise, the developers are working to fix this but in the mean time RSM can only generate a random amount of beats and/or measures. Please be patient, we are working as hard as we can.
