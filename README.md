# Random-Song-Maker
# Version 2.0.0
<P><B> VERSION 2.0.0 HAS BEEN RELEASED, RSM SHOULD MAKE NOISE NOW</B></P>
A student project designed to generate a random song based off of parameters set by the user.
As of Version 2.0.0 the user must enter the code in order to edit the perameters of the song. RSM is still in beta and probably has a few problems, we will be working to fix these, 
if you find a bug please message Vannilaorange so he can try and fix it, thank you.
